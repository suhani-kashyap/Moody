# Moody
Sentiment Analysis using deepface and CV in Python.


Moody is a desktop application built completely in Python. Ever confused about what to listen to? We've got you! Moody captures an image which uses your mood to play music for you!


The front-end is made using the Python Library Tkinter. The sentiment analysis is performed using Deepface and CV. 


We made this project at the McGill AI Society Hackathon Fall 2022 where it won the Beginner Level. Being completely new to the world of AI we learned a lot from this project!
